|fpga_name| Getting Started Guide
============================================================================================

The getting started guides that follow this page will walk you through the complete (|flow_name|) flow for
getting an example FireSim simulation up and running using an on-premises |fpga_name_short|_ FPGA,
from scratch.

First, we'll set up your environment, then run a simulation of a single RISC-V Rocket-based 
SoC booting Linux, using a pre-built bitstream. Next, we'll show you how to build your own FPGA
bitstreams for a custom hardware design. After you complete these guides, you can
look at the "Advanced Docs" in the sidebar to the left.

Here's a high-level outline of what we'll be doing in this guide:
