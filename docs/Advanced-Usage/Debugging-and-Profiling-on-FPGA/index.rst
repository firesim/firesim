Debugging and Profiling on the FPGA
======================================

A common issue with FPGA-prototyping is the difficulty involved in trying to
debug and profile systems once they are running on the FPGA. FireSim addresses
these issues with a variety of tools for introspecting on designs *once
you have a FireSim simulation running on an FPGA*. This section describes these
features.
