Targets
=======

FireSim generates SoC models by transforming RTL emitted by a Chisel
generator, such as the Rocket SoC generator. Subject to
conditions outlined in :ref:`rtl-restrictions`, if it can be
generated by Chisel, it can be simulated in FireSim.

.. _rtl-restrictions:

Restrictions on Target RTL
--------------------------

Current limitations in Golden Gate place the following restrictions on the (FIR)RTL that can be
transformed and thus used in FireSim:

#. The RTL must not contain multiple clock domains.
#. Black boxes must be "clock-gateable" by replacing its input clock with a gated equivalent.
#. Asynchronous reset must only be implemented using Rocket Chip's black box async reset. 
   These are replaced with synchronously reset registers using a FIRRTL transformation.

.. _verilog-ip:

--------------------
Including Verilog IP
--------------------

FireSim now supports target designs that incorporate Verilog IP using the standard ``BlackBox``
`interface from Chisel <https://github.com/freechipsproject/chisel3/wiki/Blackboxes>`_. For an
example of how to add Verilog IP to a target system based on Rocket Chip, see the `Incorporating
Verilog Blocks
<https://chipyard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Customization/Incorporating-Verilog-Blocks.html>`_
section of the Chipyard documentation.

#. For the transform to work, the Chisel Blackbox that wraps the Verilog IP must have a single clock
   input that can safely be clock-gated.
#. The compiler that produces the decoupled simulator ("FAME Transform") automatically recognizes
   such blackboxes inside the target design.
#. The compiler automatically gates the clock to the Verilog IP to ensure that it deterministically
   advances in lockstep with the rest of the simulator.
#. This allows any Verilog module with a single clock input to be instantiated anywhere in the target
   design using the standard Chisel Blackbox interface.

Provided Target Designs
-----------------------

-----------------------------
Target Generator Organization
-----------------------------

FireSim provides multiple `projects`, each for a different type of target. Each
project has its own chisel generator that invokes Golden Gate, its own driver
sources, and a makefrag that plugs into the Make-based build system that
resides in ``sim/``.  These projects are:

1. **firesim** (Default): rocket chip-based targets. These include targets with
   either BOOM or rocket pipelines, and should be your starting point if you're
   building an SoC with the Rocket Chip generator.
2. **midasexamples**: the `Golden Gate example designs
   <https://github.com/ucb-bar/midas-examples>`_, a set of simple chisel
   circuits like GCD, that demonstrate how to use Golden Gate.  These are useful test
   cases for bringing up new Golden Gate features.
3. **fasedtests**: designs to do integration testing of FASED memory-system timing models.

Projects have the following directory structure:

.. code-block:: text

    sim/
    ├-Makefile # Top-level makefile for projects where FireSim is the top-level repo
    ├-Makefrag # Target-agnostic makefrag, with recipes to generate drivers and RTL simulators
    ├-src/main/scala/{target-project}/
    │                └─Makefrag # Defines target-specific make variables and recipes. 
    ├-src/main/cc/{target-project}/
    │             ├─{driver-csrcs}.cc # The target's simulation driver, and sofware-model sources
    │             └─{driver-headers}.h
    └-src/main/makefrag/{target-project}/
                         ├─Generator.scala # Contains the main class that generates target RTL and calls Golden Gate
                         └─{other-scala-sources}.scala

----------------------------
Specifying A Target Instance
----------------------------

To generate a specific instance of a target, the build system leverages four Make variables:

1. ``TARGET_PROJECT``: this points the Makefile (`sim/Makefile`) at the right
   target-specific Makefrag, which defines the generation and MIDAS-level
   software-simulation recipes.  The makefrag for the default target project is
   defined at ``sim/src/main/makefrag/firesim``.

2. ``DESIGN``: the name of the top-level Chisel module to generate (a Scala class name). These are defined
   in FireChip Chipyard generator.

3. ``TARGET_CONFIG``: specifies a ``Config`` instance that is consumed by the target design's
   generator. For the default firesim target project, predefined configs are described in
   in the FireChip Chipyard generator.

4. ``PLATFORM_CONFIG``: specifies a ``Config`` instance that is consumed by
   Golden Gate and specifies compiler-level and host-land
   parameters, such as whether to enable assertion synthesis, or multi-ported RAM optimizations.
   Common platform configs are described in ``firesim-lib/sim/src/main/scala/configs/CompilerConfigs.scala``).

``TARGET_CONFIG`` and ``PLATFORM_CONFIG`` are strings that are used to construct a
``Config`` instance (derives from RocketChip's parameterization system, ``Config``, see 
`freechips.rocketchip.config
<https://github.com/freechipsproject/rocket-chip/blob/master/src/main/scala/config/Config.scala>`_). These strings are of the form
"{..._}{<Class Name>\_}<Class Name>". Only the final, base class name is
compulsory: class names that are prepended with "_" are used to create a
compound Config instance.

.. code-block:: scala

    // Specify by setting TARGET_CONFIG=Base
    class Base extends Config((site, here, up) => {...})
    class Override1 extends Config((site, here, up) => {...})
    class Override2 extends Config((site, here, up) => {...})
    // Specify by setting TARGET_CONFIG=Compound
    class Compound extends Config(new Override2 ++ new Override1 ++ new Base)
    // OR by setting TARGET_CONFIG=Override2_Override1_Base
    // Can specify undefined classes this way. ex: TARGET_CONFIG=Override2_Base

With this scheme, you don't need to define a Config class for every instance you
wish to generate. We use this scheme to specify FPGA frequencies (eg.
"BaseF1Config_F90MHz") in manager build recipes, but it's also very useful for doing
sweeping over a parameterization space. 

**Note that the precedence of Configs decreases from left to right in a string**.  Appending a config to an existing one will only have an effect if it
sets a field not already set in higher precendence Configs. For example, "BaseF1Config_F90MHz" is equivalent to
"BaseF1Config_F90MHz_F80MHz" as ``DesiredHostFrequency`` resolves to 90 MHz,
but "F90MHz_BaseF1Config" is distinct from "F80MHz_F90MHz_BaseF1Config" in
that ``DesiredHostFrequency`` resolves to 90 and 80 MHz respectively.


How a particular Config resolves it's ``Field`` s can be unintuitive for complex
compound ``Config`` s.  One precise way to check a config is doing what you
expect is to open the scala REPL, instantiate an instance of the desired
``Config``, and inspect its fields.

.. code-block:: shell

    $ make sbt # Launch into SBT's shell with extra FireSim arguments

    sbt:firechip> console # Launch the REPL

    scala> val inst = (new firesim.firesim.FireSimRocketChipConfig).toInstance # Make an instance

    inst: freechips.rocketchip.config.Config = FireSimRocketChipConfig

    scala> import freechips.rocketchip.subsystem._ # Get some important Fields

    import freechips.rocketchip.subsystem.RocketTilesKey

    scala> inst(RocketTilesKey).size # Query number of cores

    res2: Int = 1

    scala> inst(RocketTilesKey).head.dcache.get.nWays # Query L1 D$ associativity

    res3: Int = 4


Rocket Chip Generator-based SoCs (firesim project)
--------------------------------------------------

Using the Make variables listed above, we give examples of generating different targets using 
the default Rocket Chip-based target project.

-----------------
Rocket-based SoCs
-----------------

Three design classes use Rocket scalar in-order pipelines.

Single core, Rocket pipeline (default)

::

    make DESIGN=FireSim TARGET_CONFIG=FireSimRocketChipConfig


Single-core, Rocket pipeline, no network interface

::

    make DESIGN=FireSimNoNIC TARGET_CONFIG=FireSimRocketChipConfig


Quad-core, Rocket pipeline

::

    make DESIGN=FireSim TARGET_CONFIG=FireSimRocketChipQuadCoreConfig


---------------
BOOM-based SoCs
---------------

The BOOM (`Berkeley Out-of-Order Machine <https://github.com/ucb-bar/riscv-boom>`_) superscalar out-of-order pipelines can also be used with the same design classes that the Rocket pipelines use. Only the TARGET_CONFIG needs to be changed, as shown below:

Single-core BOOM

::

    make DESIGN=FireSim TARGET_CONFIG=FireSimBoomConfig

Single-core BOOM, no network interface

::

    make DESIGN=FireSimNoNIC TARGET_CONFIG=FireSimBoomConfig


----------------------------------------------------------
Generating A Different FASED Memory-Timing Model Instance
----------------------------------------------------------

Golden Gate's memory-timing model generator, FASED, can elaborate a space of
different DRAM model instances: we give some typical ones here. These targets
use the Makefile-defined defaults of ``DESIGN=FireSim PLATFORM_CONFIG=BaseF1Config``.

Quad-rank DDR3 first-ready, first-come first-served memory access scheduler

::
    make TARGET_CONFIG=DDR3FRFCFS_FireSimRocketChipConfig


As above, but with a 4 MiB (maximum simulatable capacity) last-level-cache model

::

    make TARGET_CONFIG=DDR3FRFCFSLLC4MB_FireSimRocketChipConfig

FASED *timing-model* configurations are passed to the FASED Bridges
in your Target's FIRRTL, and so must be prepended to ``TARGET_CONFIG``.


Midas Examples (midasexamples project)
--------------------------------------------------
This project can generate a handful of toy target-designs (set with the make
variable ``DESIGN``). Each of these designs has their own chisel source file and serves to demostrate
the features of Golden Gate.

Some notable examples are:

#. ``GCD``: the "Hello World!" of hardware.
#. ``WireInterconnect``: demonstrates how combinational paths can be modeled with Golden Gate.
#. ``PrintfModule``: demonstrates synthesizable printfs
#. ``AssertModule``: demonstrates synthesizable assertions

To generate a target, set the make variable
``TARGET_PROJECT=midasexamples``. so that the right project makefrag is
sourced.

--------
Examples
--------

To generate the GCD midasexample:

::

    make DESIGN=GCD TARGET_PROJECT=midasexamples

FASED Tests (fasedtests project)
--------------------------------------------------
This project generates target designs capable of driving considerably more
bandwidth to an AXI4-memory slave than current FireSim targets. These are used to do
integration and stress testing of FASED instances.

--------
Examples
--------

Generate a synthesizable AXI4Fuzzer (based off of Rocket Chip's TL fuzzer), driving a
DDR3 FR-FCFS-based FASED instance.

::

    make TARGET_PROJECT=fasedtests DESIGN=AXI4Fuzzer TARGET_CONFIG=FRFCFSConfig

As above, now configured to drive 10 million transactions through the instance.

::

    make TARGET_PROJECT=fasedtests DESIGN=AXI4Fuzzer TARGET_CONFIG=NT10e7_FRFCFSConfig
