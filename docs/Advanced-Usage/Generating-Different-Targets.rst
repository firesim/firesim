Targets
=======

FireSim generates SoC models by transforming RTL emitted by a Chisel
generator, such as the Rocket SoC generator. Subject to
conditions outlined in :ref:`rtl-restrictions`, if it can be
generated by Chisel, it can be simulated in FireSim.

.. _rtl-restrictions:

Restrictions on Target-RTL
--------------------------

Current limitations in MIDAS place the following restrictions on the (FIR)RTL that can be
transformed and thus used in FireSim:

1. The RTL must not contain multiple clock domains.
2. The RTL must not contain multi-cycle paths.
3. The RTL must not contain black boxes, with the exception of Rocket Chip's async reset register.
4. Asynchronous reset must only be implemented using Rocket Chip's black box async reset. 
   These are replaced with synchronously reset registers using a FIRRTL transformation.


.. _generating-different-targets:

Generating Different Target-RTL
---------------------------------

FireSim provides multiple `projects`, each for a different type of target. Each
project has it's own chisel generator that invokes MIDAS, its own driver
sources, and a makefrag that plugs into the Make-based build system that
resides in ``sim/``.

These projects are:

1. **firesim** (Default): rocket chip-based targets. These include targets with
   either BOOM or rocket pipelines, and should be your starting point if you're
   building an SoC with the Rocket Chip generator.
2. **midasexamples**: the `MIDAS example designs
   <https://github.com/ucb-bar/midas-examples>`_, a set of simple chisel
   circuits like GCD, that demonstrate how to use MIDAS.  These are useful test
   cases for bringing up new MIDAS features.
3. **fasedtests**: designs to do integration testing of FASED memory-system timing models.

Projects have the following directory structure:

.. code-block:: text

    sim/
    ├-Makefile # Top-level makefile for projects where FireSim is the top-level repo
    ├-Makefrag # Target-agnostic makefrag, with recipes to generate drivers and RTL simulators
    ├-src/main/scala/{target-project}/
    │                └─Makefrag # Defines target-specific make variables and recipes. 
    ├-src/main/cc/{target-project}/
    │             ├─{driver-csrcs}.cc # The target's simulation driver, and sofware-model sources
    │             └─{driver-headers}.h
    └-src/main/makefrag/{target-project}/
                         ├─Generator.scala # Contains the main class that generates target RTL and calls MIDAS
                         └─{other-scala-sources}.scala

Rocket Chip Generator-based SoCs (firesim project)
--------------------------------------------------
This project can generate four different target-design
classes (set with the make variable ``DESIGN``, see
``sim/src/main/scala/firesim/Targets.scala``). Like any other Rocket Chip-derived
generator, a different parameterization is selected with a Chisel configuration
(make variable ``TARGET_CONFIG``, see
``sim/src/main/scala/firesim/TargetConfigs.scala``). Since I/O and DRAM models are not
generated by Rocket Chip but by MIDAS, their parameterization is
captured in a second Chisel configuration (make
variable ``PLATFORM_CONFIG``, see ``sim/src/main/scala/firesim/SimConfigs.scala``).

We give examples of generating different targets using these three
variables in the sections that follow.

-----------------
Rocket-based SoCs
-----------------

Three design classes use Rocket scalar in-order pipelines.

Single core, Rocket pipeline (default)

::

    make DESIGN=FireSim TARGET_CONFIG=FireSimRocketChipConfig


Single-core, Rocket pipeline, no network interface

::

    make DESIGN=FireSimNoNIC TARGET_CONFIG=FireSimRocketChipConfig


Quad-core, Rocket pipeline

::

    make DESIGN=FireSim TARGET_CONFIG=FireSimRocketChipQuadCoreConfig


---------------
BOOM-based SoCs
---------------

Two design classes use BOOM (`Berkeley Out-of-Order Machine <https://github.com/ucb-bar/riscv-boom>`_) superscalar out-of-order pipelines.

Single-core BOOM

::

    make DESIGN=FireBoom TARGET_CONFIG=FireSimBoomConfig

Single-core BOOM, no network interface

::

    make DESIGN=FireBoomNoNIC TARGET_CONFIG=FireSimBoomConfig


----------------------------------------------------------
Generating A Different FASED Memory-Timing Model Instance
----------------------------------------------------------

MIDAS's memory-timing model generator, FASED, can elaborate a space of
different DRAM model instances: we give some typical ones here. These targets
use the Makefile-defined defaults of
``DESIGN=FireSim TARGET_CONFIG=FireSimRocketChipConfig``.

Quad-rank DDR3 first-come first-served memory access scheduler

::

    make PLATFORM_CONFIG=FireSimDDR3FCFSConfig

Quad-rank DDR3 first-ready, first-come first-served memory access scheduler

::

    make PLATFORM_CONFIG=FireSimDDR3FRFCFSConfig


As above, but with a 4 MiB (maximum simulatable capacity) last-level-cache model

::

    make PLATFORM_CONFIG=FireSimDDR3FRFCFSLLC4MBConfig


Midas Examples (midasexamples project)
--------------------------------------------------
This project can generate nine different target-designs (set with the make
variable ``DESIGN``), each of these designs has their own chisel source file.
They include:

1. EnableShiftRegister
2. GCD
3. Parity
4. PointerChaser
5. ResetShiftRegister
6. Risc
7. RiscSRAM
8. ShiftRegister
9. Stack


To generate MIDAS example targets, set the make variable
``TARGET_PROJECT=midasexamples``. so that the right project makefrag is
sourced.

--------
Examples
--------

Generate the GCD midas-example

::

    make DESIGN=GCD TARGET_PROJECT=midasexamples

FASED Tests (fasedtests project)
--------------------------------------------------
This project generates target designs capable of driving considerably more
bandwidth to an AXI4-memory slave than current FireSim-targets. Used used to do
integration and stress testing of FASED instances.

--------
Examples
--------

Generate a synthesizable AXI4Fuzzer (based off of Rocket Chip's TL fuzzer), driving a
DDR3 FR-FCFS-based FASED instance.

::

    make TARGET_PROJECT=midasexamples DESIGN=AXI4Fuzzer PLATFORM_CONFIG=FRFCFSConfig

As above, but with a fuzzer configue to drive 10 million transactions through
the instance.

::

    make TARGET_PROJECT=midasexamples DESIGN=AXI4Fuzzer PLATFORM_CONFIG=NT10e7_FRFCFSConfig
