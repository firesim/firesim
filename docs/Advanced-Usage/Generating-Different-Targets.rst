Targets
=======

FireSim generates SoC models by transforming RTL emitted by a Chisel
generator, such as the Rocket SoC generator. Subject to
conditions outlined in :ref:`rtl-restrictions`, if it can be
generated by Chisel, it can be simulated in FireSim.

.. _rtl-restrictions:

Restrictions on Target RTL
--------------------------

Current limitations in MIDAS place the following restrictions on the (FIR)RTL that can be
transformed and thus used in FireSim:

1. The RTL must not contain multiple clock domains.
2. The RTL must not contain multi-cycle paths.
3. The RTL must not contain black boxes, with the exception of Rocket Chip's async reset register.
4. Asynchronous reset must only be implemented using Rocket Chip's black box async reset. 
   These are replaced with synchronously reset registers using a FIRRTL transformation.

Provided Target Designs
-----------------------

-----------------------------
Target Generator Organization
-----------------------------

FireSim provides multiple `projects`, each for a different type of target. Each
project has it's own chisel generator that invokes MIDAS, its own driver
sources, and a makefrag that plugs into the Make-based build system that
resides in ``sim/``.  These projects are:

1. **firesim** (Default): rocket chip-based targets. These include targets with
   either BOOM or rocket pipelines, and should be your starting point if you're
   building an SoC with the Rocket Chip generator.
2. **midasexamples**: the `MIDAS example designs
   <https://github.com/ucb-bar/midas-examples>`_, a set of simple chisel
   circuits like GCD, that demonstrate how to use MIDAS.  These are useful test
   cases for bringing up new MIDAS features.
3. **fasedtests**: designs to do integration testing of FASED memory-system timing models.

Projects have the following directory structure:

.. code-block:: text

    sim/
    ├-Makefile # Top-level makefile for projects where FireSim is the top-level repo
    ├-Makefrag # Target-agnostic makefrag, with recipes to generate drivers and RTL simulators
    ├-src/main/scala/{target-project}/
    │                └─Makefrag # Defines target-specific make variables and recipes. 
    ├-src/main/cc/{target-project}/
    │             ├─{driver-csrcs}.cc # The target's simulation driver, and sofware-model sources
    │             └─{driver-headers}.h
    └-src/main/makefrag/{target-project}/
                         ├─Generator.scala # Contains the main class that generates target RTL and calls MIDAS
                         └─{other-scala-sources}.scala

----------------------------
Specifying A Target Instance
----------------------------

To generate a specific instance of a target, the build system leverages four Make variables:

1. ``TARGET_PROJECT``: this points the Makefile (`sim/Makefile`) at the right
   target-specific Makefrag, which defines the generation and MIDAS-level
   software-simulation recipes.  The makefrag for the default target project is
   defined at ``sim/src/main/makefrag/firesim``.

2. ``DESIGN``: the name of the top-level Chisel module to generate (a Scala class name). For the default firesim target project,
   a common set of top-level modules is captured in ``sim/src/main/scala/firesim/Targets.scala``.

3. ``TARGET_CONFIG``: specifies a ``Config`` instance that is consumed by the target design's
   generator. For the default firesim target project, predefined configs are described in
   ``sim/src/main/scala/firesim/TargetConfigs.scala``).

4. ``PLATFORM_CONFIG``: specifies a ``Config`` instance that is consumed by MIDAS and specifies simulation-land
   parameters, such as whether to enable assertion synthesis, how to assign
   endpoints to target I/O, and what sorts of endpoints to generate (ex. the
   specific FASED timing model instance to generate.).
   For the default firesim target project, predefined platform configs are described in
   ``sim/src/main/scala/firesim/SimConfigs.scala``)

``TARGET_CONFIG`` and ``PLATFORM_CONFIG`` are strings that are used to construct a
``Config`` instance (derives from RocketChip's parameterization system, ``Config``, see 
`freechips.rocketchip.config
<https://github.com/freechipsproject/rocket-chip/blob/master/src/main/scala/config/Config.scala>`_). These strings are of the form
"ClassName{_ClassName2}{_ClassName3}{_...}". Only the first class name is
compulsory, successive class names are prepended to the first to create a
compound Config instance. See the example below:

.. code-block:: scala

    // Specify by setting TARGET_CONFIG=Base
    class Base extends Config((site, here, up) => {...})
    class Override1 extends Config((site, here, up) => {...})
    class Override2 extends Config((site, here, up) => {...})
    // Specify by setting TARGET_CONFIG=Compound
    class Compound extends Config(new Override2 ++ new Override1 ++ new Base)
    // OR by setting TARGET_CONFIG=Base_Override1_Override2
    // Can specify undefined classes this way. ex: TARGET_CONFIG=Base_Override2

With this scheme, you don't need to define a Config class for every instance you
wish to generate. We use this scheme to specify FPGA frequencies (eg.
BaseF1Config_F90MHz) in manager build recipes, but it's also very useful for doing
sweeping over a parameterization space.


Rocket Chip Generator-based SoCs (firesim project)
--------------------------------------------------

Using the Make variables listed above, we give examples of generating different targets using 
the default Rocket Chip-based target project.

-----------------
Rocket-based SoCs
-----------------

Three design classes use Rocket scalar in-order pipelines.

Single core, Rocket pipeline (default)

::

    make DESIGN=FireSim TARGET_CONFIG=FireSimRocketChipConfig


Single-core, Rocket pipeline, no network interface

::

    make DESIGN=FireSimNoNIC TARGET_CONFIG=FireSimRocketChipConfig


Quad-core, Rocket pipeline

::

    make DESIGN=FireSim TARGET_CONFIG=FireSimRocketChipQuadCoreConfig


---------------
BOOM-based SoCs
---------------

Two design classes use BOOM (`Berkeley Out-of-Order Machine <https://github.com/ucb-bar/riscv-boom>`_) superscalar out-of-order pipelines.

Single-core BOOM

::

    make DESIGN=FireBoom TARGET_CONFIG=FireSimBoomConfig

Single-core BOOM, no network interface

::

    make DESIGN=FireBoomNoNIC TARGET_CONFIG=FireSimBoomConfig


----------------------------------------------------------
Generating A Different FASED Memory-Timing Model Instance
----------------------------------------------------------

MIDAS's memory-timing model generator, FASED, can elaborate a space of
different DRAM model instances: we give some typical ones here. These targets
use the Makefile-defined defaults of
``DESIGN=FireSim TARGET_CONFIG=FireSimRocketChipConfig``.

Quad-rank DDR3 first-come first-served memory access scheduler

::

    make PLATFORM_CONFIG=FireSimDDR3FCFSConfig

Quad-rank DDR3 first-ready, first-come first-served memory access scheduler

::

    make PLATFORM_CONFIG=FireSimDDR3FRFCFSConfig


As above, but with a 4 MiB (maximum simulatable capacity) last-level-cache model

::

    make PLATFORM_CONFIG=FireSimDDR3FRFCFSLLC4MBConfig


Midas Examples (midasexamples project)
--------------------------------------------------
This project can generate nine different target-designs (set with the make
variable ``DESIGN``), each of these designs has their own chisel source file.
They include:

1. EnableShiftRegister
2. GCD
3. Parity
4. PointerChaser
5. ResetShiftRegister
6. Risc
7. RiscSRAM
8. ShiftRegister
9. Stack


To generate MIDAS example targets, set the make variable
``TARGET_PROJECT=midasexamples``. so that the right project makefrag is
sourced.

--------
Examples
--------

Generate the GCD midas-example

::

    make DESIGN=GCD TARGET_PROJECT=midasexamples

FASED Tests (fasedtests project)
--------------------------------------------------
This project generates target designs capable of driving considerably more
bandwidth to an AXI4-memory slave than current FireSim-targets. Used used to do
integration and stress testing of FASED instances.

--------
Examples
--------

Generate a synthesizable AXI4Fuzzer (based off of Rocket Chip's TL fuzzer), driving a
DDR3 FR-FCFS-based FASED instance.

::

    make TARGET_PROJECT=midasexamples DESIGN=AXI4Fuzzer PLATFORM_CONFIG=FRFCFSConfig

As above, but with a fuzzer configue to drive 10 million transactions through
the instance.

::

    make TARGET_PROJECT=midasexamples DESIGN=AXI4Fuzzer PLATFORM_CONFIG=NT10e7_FRFCFSConfig
