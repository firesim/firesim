Targets
================

FireSim generates SoC models by transforming RTL emitted by a Chisel
generator, such as the Rocket SoC generator. Subject to
conditions outlined in :ref:`rtl-restrictions`, if it can be
generated by Chisel, it can be simulated in FireSim.

.. _rtl-restrictions:

Restrictions on Target-RTL
--------------------------

Current limitations in MIDAS place the following restrictions on the (FIR)RTL that can be
transformed and thus used in FireSim:

1. The RTL must not contain multiple clock domains.
2. The RTL must not contain multi-cycle paths.
3. The RTL must not contain black boxes, with the exception of Rocket Chip's async reset register.
4. Asynchronous reset must only be implemented using Rocket Chip's black box async reset. 
   These are replaced with synchronously reset registers using a FIRRTL transformation.


Generating Different Target-RTL
---------------------------------

FireSim provides Rocket Chip-derived RTL generators for four target-design
classes (set with the make variable ``DESIGN``, see
``sim/src/main/scala/Targets.scala``). Like any other Rocket Chip-derived
generator, a different parameterization is selected with a Chisel configuration
(make variable ``TARGET_CONFIG``, see
``sim/src/main/scala/TargetConfigs.scala``). Since I/O and DRAM models are not
generated by Rocket Chip but by MIDAS, their parameterization is
captured in a second Chisel configuration (make
variable ``PLATFORM_CONFIG``, see ``sim/src/main/scala/SimConfigs.scala``).

We give examples of generating different targets using these three
variables in the sections that follow.

-----------------
Rocket-based SoCs
-----------------

Two design classes use Rocket scalar in-order pipelines.

Single core, Rocket pipeline (default)

::

    make DESIGN=FireSim TARGET_CONFIG=FireSimRocketChipConfig


Single-core, Rocket pipeline, no network interface

::

    make DESIGN=FireSimNoNIC TARGET_CONFIG=FireSimRocketChipConfig


Quad-core, Rocket pipeline

::

    make DESIGN=FireSim TARGET_CONFIG=FireSimRocketChipQuadCoreConfig


----------------------
BOOM-based SoCs (Beta)
----------------------

Two design classes use BOOM (`Berkeley Out-of-Order Machine <https://github.com/ucb-bar/riscv-boom>`_) superscalar out-of-order pipelines.

Single-core BOOM

::

    make DESIGN=FireBoom TARGET_CONFIG=FireSimBoomConfig

Single-core BOOM, no network interface

::

    make DESIGN=FireBoomNoNIC TARGET_CONFIG=FireSimBoomConfig


-----------------------
Changing The DRAM Model
-----------------------

MIDAS can generate a space of different DRAM model instances: we give some
typical ones here. These targets use the Makefile-defined defaults of
``DESIGN=FireSim TARGET_CONFIG=FireSimRocketChipConfig``.

Quad-rank DDR3 first-come first-served memory access scheduler

::

    make PLATFORM_CONFIG=FireSimDDR3FCFSConfig

Quad-rank DDR3 first-ready, first-come first-served memory access scheduler

::

    make PLATFORM_CONFIG=FireSimDDR3FRFCFSConfig


As above, but with an 4 MiB (max capacity) last-level-cache model

::

    make PLATFORM_CONFIG=FireSimDDR3FRFCFSLLC4MBConfig
