Miscellaneous Tips
=============================

.. _fsimcluster-aws-panel:

Add the ``fsimcluster`` column to your AWS management console
----------------------------------------------------------------

Once you've deployed a simulation once with the manager, the AWS management console
will allow you to add a custom column that will allow you to see at-a-glance
which FireSim run farm an instance belongs to.

To do so, click the gear in the top right of the AWS management console. From
there, you should see a checkbox for ``fsimcluster``. Enable it to see the column.

FPGA Dev AMI Remote Desktop Setup
-----------------------------------

To Remote Desktop into your manager instance, you must do the following:

::

    curl https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-fpga-developer-ami/1.5.0/Scripts/setup_gui.sh -o /home/centos/src/scripts/setup_gui.sh
    sudo sed -i 's/enabled=0/enabled=1/g' /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-CR.repo
    /home/centos/src/scripts/setup_gui.sh
    # keep manager paramiko compatibility
    sudo pip2 uninstall gssapi

Experimental Support for SSHing into simulated nodes and accessing the internet from within simulations
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is assuming that you are simulating a 1-node networked cluster. These instructions
will let you both ssh into the simulated node and access the outside internet from within
the simulated node:

1. Set your config files to simulate a 1-node networked cluster (``example_1config``)
2. Run ``firesim launchrunfarm && firesim infrasetup`` and wait for them to complete
3. cd to ``firesim/target-design/switch/``
4. Go into the newest directory that is prefixed with ``switch0-``
5. Edit the ``switchconfig.h`` file so that it looks like this:

::

    // THIS FILE IS MACHINE GENERATED. SEE deploy/buildtools/switchmodelconfig.py

    #ifdef NUMCLIENTSCONFIG
    #define NUMPORTS 2
    #endif
    #ifdef PORTSETUPCONFIG
    ports[0] = new ShmemPort(0);
    ports[1] = new SSHPort(1);
    #endif

    #ifdef MACPORTSCONFIG
    uint16_t mac2port[3]  {1, 2, 0};
    #endif


6. Run ``make`` then ``cp switch switch0``
7. Run ``scp switch0 YOUR_RUN_FARM_INSTANCE_IP:switch_slot_0/switch0``
8. On the RUN FARM INSTANCE, run:

::

    sudo ip tuntap add mode tap dev tap0 user $USER
    sudo ip link set tap0 up
    sudo ip addr add 172.16.0.1/16 dev tap0
    sudo ifconfig tap0 hw ether 8e:6b:35:04:00:00
    sudo sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.tap0.disable_ipv6=1


9. Run ``firesim runworkload``. Confirm that the node has booted to the login prompt in the fsim0 screen.

10. To ssh into the simulated machine, you will need to first ssh onto the Run Farm instance, then ssh into the IP address of the simulated node (172.16.0.2), username root, password firesim. You should also prefix with TERM=linux to get backspace to work correctly: So:

::

    ssh YOUR_RUN_FARM_INSTANCE_IP
    # from within the run farm instance:
    TERM=linux ssh root@172.16.0.2


11. To also be able to access the internet from within the simulation, run the following
on the RUN FARM INSTANCE:

::

    sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
    export EXT_IF_TO_USE=$(ifconfig -a | sed 's/[ \t].*//;/^\(lo:\|\)$/d' | sed 's/[ \t].*//;/^\(tap0:\|\)$/d' | sed 's/://g')
    sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i $EXT_IF_TO_USE -o tap0 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
    sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i tap0 -o $EXT_IF_TO_USE -j ACCEPT
    sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o $EXT_IF_TO_USE -j MASQUERADE


12. Then run the following in the simulation:

::

    route add default gw 172.16.0.1 eth0
    echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" >> /etc/resolv.conf
    echo "nameserver 8.8.4.4" >> /etc/resolv.conf


At this point, you will be able to access the outside internet, e.g. ``ping google.com`` or ``wget google.com``.


Navigating the FireSim Codebase
---------------------------------

This is a large codebase with tons of dependencies, so navigating it can be
difficult. By default, a ``tags`` file is generated when you run
``./build-setup.sh`` which aids in jumping around the codebase. This file is
generated by Exuberant Ctags and many editors support using this file to jump
around the codebase. You can also regenerate the ``tags`` file if you make code changes
by running ``./gen-tags.sh`` in your FireSim repo.

For example, to use these tags to jump around the codebase in ``vim``, add the following to
your ``.vimrc``:

::

    set tags=tags;/


Then, you can move the cursor over something you want to jump to and hit
``ctrl-]`` to jump to the definition and ``ctrl-t`` to jump back out. E.g. in
top-level configurations in FireSim, you can jump all the way down through the
Rocket Chip codebase and even down to Chisel.
