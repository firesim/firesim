## [1.0.0] - 2017-08-29

### Added

This was a closed-source, but free-to-use demo of FireSim released on
[AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B0758SR46G) with our 
[AWS Compute Blog Post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/bringing-datacenter-scale-hardware-software-co-design-to-the-cloud-with-firesim-and-amazon-ec2-f1-instances/)
in August 2017. This was built from a very old version of FireSim and no
longer supported, but noted here to explain why the versioning of this repo
starts at 1.1.0.
