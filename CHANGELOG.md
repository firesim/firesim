## [1.8.0] - 2020-01-25

A more detailed account of everything included is included in the dev to master PR for this release: https://github.com/firesim/firesim/pull/413

### Added
* Black-box Verilog support via external clock-gating PR #388 
  * For the transform to work, the Chisel `Blackbox` that wraps the Verilog IP must have a single clock input that can safely be clock-gated.
  * The compiler that produces the decoupled simulator ("FAME Transform") automatically recognizes such blackboxes inside the target design.
  * The compiler automatically gates the clock to the Verilog IP to ensure that it deterministically advances in lockstep with the rest of the simulator.
  * This allows any Verilog module with a single clock input to be instantiated anywhere in the target design using the standard Chisel `Blackbox` interface.
* Added chisel assertions to check for token irrevocability (non-determinism check) PR #416 
  * Enable by adding `HostDebugFeatures` to your `PLATFORM_CONFIG`
* Support for QCOW2 disk images in the manager. This means that FireSim simulations can now boot directly from qcow2 images---the default linux-uniform image is 40MB as a qcow2 image as opposed to 2GB as a raw .img. Firemarshal support for generating these images is upcoming. This is PR #415 and resolves #411 
* AutoCounter and Trigger features from FirePerf paper (PR #437)

### Changed
* Default buildfarm instances changed from c5.4xlarges to z1d.2xlarges #464  
* Update to Chipyard 1.1.0
* Update FireMarshal to 1.8. This drastically reduces the default root filesystem image sizes and allows for FireMarshal workloads to be in any directory (not just the workloads/ directory).

### Fixed
* Fix managerinit aws configure bug introduced by tutorial modifications. managerinit now correctly runs aws configure again, there is no need to run it separately (docs are updated to reflect this)
* Supernode: Copying back results from supernode simulations now works for all rootfses, not just the zeroeth rootfs of a supernode sim. PR #415 
* Manager: No longer double-copies results for a node that is responsible for triggering a teardown in the networked simulation case. PR #415 

### Deprecated
* N/A

### Removed
* MIDAS submodule removed, now inlined in this repo ([MIDAS]-prefixed commits denote commits that originate from that repo) PR #400

* Endpoint clock-domain-crossing support https://github.com/firesim/firesim/pull/49
* Add synthesizeable unit tests from MIDAS
* Switch model token compression on empty batches of tokens to save BW when many links cross EC2 network. Does not compromise cycle-accuracy.
* **Debugging**: Assertion Synthesis
    * Assertions can now be synthesized and caught during FPGA-hosted simulation: http://docs.fires.im/en/latest/Advanced-Usage/Debugging/DESSERT.html
* **Debugging**: TracerV Widget
    * Widget for getting committed instruction trace from Rocket/BOOM to the host machine quickly using PCIS DMA
    * See documentation at: http://docs.fires.im/en/latest/Advanced-Usage/Debugging/TracerV.html

* verilator is now installed by the machine launch script 
* Rebuild EDMA driver on Run Farm nodes. This fixes a potential kernel version mismatch issue due to AWS GUI scripts

### Added

* Auto-ILA added: Annotate Chisel code to automatically wire-up an ILA
  * Enables ILA-based debugging of the FPGA simulation
  * Automatic generation and wiring of FPGA ILA, based on chisel annotations in relevant source code (target source code or simulation source code). This is done using the ILATopWiring transformation. Generates several partial Verilog files which are included in the top-level cl_firesim.sv file.
  * Includes refactoring of midas to allow post-midas host-transformations (in addition to the already existing target transformations)
  * Documentation and integration into manager for ease of use
* sim/Make system fractured into:
  * `sim/Makefile` -- the top-level Makefile
  * `sim/Makefrag` -- target-agnostic recipes for build simulators and simulation drivers and 
  * `sim/src/main/makefrag/<project>/Makefrag` -- target specific recipes for generating RTL
  * this makes it easier to submodule firesim from a larger project, and allows for multiple target projects to coexist within FireSim
  * see `Targets/Generating Different Target-RTL` in Advanced Docs. 
* MIDAS-examples added (Resolves https://github.com/firesim/firesim/issues/81 )
  * live in `sim/src/main/{cc, scala, makefrag}/midas-examples`
  * a suite of simple circuits like GCD to demonstrate MIDAS/FireSim
  * these serve as good smoke tests for bringing up features in MIDAS
  * see `Targets/Midas Examples` in Advanced Docs. 
* Scalatests updated
  * generates all of the MIDAS-examples, a Rocket- and Boom-based target and runs them through midas-level simulation.
    * good regression test for bumping/changing chisel/firrtl/rocket chip/midas
* Better ctags support. Script to generate ctags efficiently in `gen-tags.sh`. Also called by build-setup process. On a fresh clone, gen-tags.sh only takes ~10s. Resolves #79 
  * Generated across: target-design code, all shim code, driver code, workloads, etc.


## [1.3.1] - 2018-08-18

### Changed

* Update version of BOOM included as a target in FireSim. The included version/configurations now reliably boot Linux and run SPEC. The FireSim NIC/network is also supported.
* Update IP addressing for simulated nodes to prevent a conflict between host IP range and simulation IP range. Simulations now live in 172.16.0.0/16 instead of 192.168.0.0/24.
* Update experimental SSH into target instructions to account for different interface names across EC2 instance types. This fixes the ability to access the internet from within simulated nodes.


## [1.3.0] - 2018-08-11

### Changed

* **IMPORTANT**: `aws-fpga-firesim` is updated to the upstream [`aws-fpga` 1.4.0 Shell release](https://github.com/aws/aws-fpga/releases/tag/v1.4.0). This is a **REQUIRED** update for all users, as AWS will be removing support for old shells after September 1st, 2018. See this release note from AWS: https://github.com/aws/aws-fpga/blob/master/RELEASE_NOTES.md#release-140-see-errata-for-unsupported-features. In addition to pulling in the changes to the FireSim codebase for this release, you will need to launch a new manager instance using Amazon FPGA Developer AMI version 1.4.0. The documentation is updated to reflect this.
* For users that cannot update directly to FireSim 1.3.0 because they cannot switch to the version of Rocket Chip updated in FireSim 1.2.0, a backport branch that adds the AWS FPGA 1.4.0 Shell to FireSim 1.1 is provided here: https://github.com/firesim/firesim/tree/firesim-1.1-aws-1.4.0-backport. In addition to pulling in the changes to the FireSim codebase for this branch, you will need to launch a new manager instance using Amazon FPGA Developer AMI version 1.4.0. The documentation is updated to reflect this.

### Added

* A new flag now allows zeroing FPGA-attached DRAM before simulation. This is enabled by default in the manager.
* New docs that explain how to `ssh` into simulated nodes.


## [1.2.0] - 2018-07-14

### Added

* FireSim now has beta support for simulating [BOOM](https://github.com/ucb-bar/riscv-boom)-based nodes. BOOM is the Berkeley Out-of-Order Machine, a superscalar out-of-order RISC-V Core. See the following page for usage instructions: https://docs.fires.im/en/1.2/Advanced-Usage/Generating-Different-Targets.html#boom-based-socs-beta

### Changed

* Rocket Chip has now been bumped to a version from April 23, 2018.


## [1.1.0] - 2018-05-21

## [1.0.0] - 2017-08-29

### Added

This was a closed-source, but free-to-use demo of FireSim released on
[AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B0758SR46G) with our 
[AWS Compute Blog Post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/bringing-datacenter-scale-hardware-software-co-design-to-the-cloud-with-firesim-and-amazon-ec2-f1-instances/)
in August 2017. This was built from a very old version of FireSim and no
longer supported, but noted here to explain why the versioning of this repo
starts at 1.1.0.
