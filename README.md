## Using FireSim

To get started with using FireSim, see the tutorials on the FireSim documentation
site: https://docs.fires.im/. 

Another good overview (in video format) is our tutorial from the Chisel Community Conference on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3OriQnJXYQ).

## What is FireSim?

FireSim is an [open-source](https://github.com/firesim/firesim) cycle-accurate
FPGA-accelerated full-system hardware simulation platform that runs on cloud FPGAs (Amazon EC2 F1).
FireSim is actively developed in the [Berkeley Architecture Research
Group][ucb-bar] in the [Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences
Department][eecs] at the [University of California, Berkeley][berkeley].
You can learn more about FireSim in the following places:

## What can I simulate with FireSim?

FireSim can simulate arbitrary hardware designs written in
[Chisel](https://chisel.eecs.berkeley.edu).  With FireSim, you
can write your own RTL (processors, accelerators, etc.) and run it at
near-FPGA-prototype speeds on cloud FPGAs, while obtaining cycle-accurate
performance results (i.e. matching what you would find if you taped-out
a chip). Depending on the hardware design and the simulation scale,
FireSim simulations run at **10s to 100s of MHz**. You can also integrate
custom software models for components that you don't want/need to write as RTL.

FireSim was originally developed to simulate datacenters by combining
open RTL for RISC-V processors with a custom cycle-accurate network simulation.
By default, FireSim provides all the RTL and models necessary
to **cycle-exactly** simulate from **one to thousands of multi-core compute
nodes**, derived directly from **silicon-proven** and **open** target-RTL
([RISC-V][riscv] [Rocket Chip][rocket-chip] and [BOOM][boom]), with an optional
**cycle-accurate network simulation** tying them together. FireSim also
provides a [Linux distribution](https://github.com/firesim/firesim-software)
that is compatible with the RISC-V systems it simulates and
[automates](https://docs.fires.im/en/latest/Advanced-Usage/Workloads/Defining-Custom-Workloads.html)
the process of including new workloads into this Linux distribution.
These simulations run fast
enough to interact with Linux on the simulated system at the command line, [like
a real
computer](https://twitter.com/firesimproject/status/1031267637303508993). Users
can even [SSH into simulated systems in
FireSim](http://docs.fires.im/en/latest/Advanced-Usage/Miscellaneous-Tips.html#experimental-support-for-sshing-into-simulated-nodes-and-accessing-the-internet-from-within-simulations)
and access the Internet from within them.
