# Hardware config database for FireSim Simulation Manager
# See docs/Advanced-Usage/Manager/Manager-Configuration-Files.rst for documentation of all of these params.

# Hardware configs represent a combination of an agfi, a deploytriplet override
# (if needed), and a custom runtime config (if needed)

# The AGFIs provided below are public and available to all users.
# Only AGFIs for the latest release of FireSim are guaranteed to be available.
# If you are using an older version of FireSim, you will need to generate your
# own images.
