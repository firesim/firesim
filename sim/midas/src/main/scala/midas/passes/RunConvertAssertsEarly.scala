  * This transform does nothing but inject a dependency such that ConvertAsserts runs as early in the compiler as
  * possible (before RemoveCHIRRTL). This permits new assertion nodes to be lowered into the old form such they can be
  * detected by AssertionSynthesis. There is currently no simple mechanism to re-associate an assert-printf pair,
  * without introducing new annotations.
