/** \class simif_t
 *
 *  @brief FireSim's main simulation class.
 *
 *  Historically this god class wrapped all of the features presented by FireSim
 *  / MIDAS-derived simulators. Critically, it declares an interface for
 *  interacting with the host-FPGA, which consist of methods for implementing
 *  32b MMIO (read, write), and latency-insensitive bridge streams (push, pull).
 *  Concrete subclasses of simif_t must be written for metasimulation and each
 *  supported host plaform. See simif_f1_t for an example.
 *  simif_t also provides a few core functions that are tied to bridges and
 *  widgets that must be present in all simulators:
 *
 *  - To track simulation time, it provides methods to interact with the
 *    ClockBridge. This bridge is solely responsible for defining a schedule of
 *    clock edges to simulate, and must be instantiated in all targets. See
 *    actual_tcycle() and hcycle().  Utilities to report performance are based
 *    off these measures of time.
 *
 *  - To read and write into FPGA DRAM, the LoadMem widget provides a
 *    low-bandwidth side channel via MMIO. See read_mem, write_mem,
 *    zero_out_dram.
