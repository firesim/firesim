/** \class simif_t
 *
 *  @brief FireSim's main simulation class.
 *
 *  Historically this god class wrapped all of the features presented by FireSim
 *  / MIDAS-derived simulators. Critically, it declares an interface for
 interacting with
 *  the host-FPGA, which consist of methods for implementing 32b MMIO (read,
 *  write), and latency-insensitive bridge streams (push, pull). Concrete
 *  subclasses of simif_t must be written for metasimulation and each supported
 *  host plaform. See simif_f1_t for an example.

 *  simif_t also provides a few core functions that are tied to bridges and
 widgets that
 *  must be present in all simulators:
 *
 *  - To track simulation time, it provides methods to interact with the
 *    ClockBridge. This bridge is solely responsible for defining a schedule of
 *    clock edges to simulate, and must be instantiated in all targets. See
 actual_tcycle() and hcycle().
 *    Utilities to report performance are based off these measures of time.
 *
 *  - To read and write into FPGA DRAM, the LoadMem widget provides a
 *    low-bandwidth side channel via MMIO. See read_mem, write_mem,
 zero_out_dram.
